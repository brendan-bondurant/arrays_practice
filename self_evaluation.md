- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    - I feel confident with creating the arrays and checking the index positions. I am slightly less confident with being able to explain what the different methods do. I can do it, but I have to think about it
- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    - I want to explore various methods more, but I think the main thing I need to do is practice explaining and demonstrating the important ones to increase my own understanding of what they can do
- What questions do you have about Arrays?
    - At the moment, my main questions all relate to manipulating them with various methods. There seems to be a lot of different methods that do different things, so I'm curious if there are methods that do the same thing but use different syntax? What happens when you add an ! after it, like in the rotate example I used in arrays.rb. That seems to happen a lot on the ruby-doc. I want to play around with that a little more to try and figure it out
